I almost forgot how I looked until I found a picture of myself in my mother's phone. Curly thick hair (my hair looks different now, maybe thinner), glowing face (now it’s dull), bright eyes. I don't remember when I took that selfie. I was someone else back then. He had something in his eyes. He was free.

I lost my phone last year, August 2024, and all my memories went along with it. I’m not saying I forgot everything before that incident, but I lost all the photos. I didn't back up anything—I know I should have—but it’s all gone.

I can’t refresh my memories by looking at old photos anymore. I can't scroll back to see how much fun I had during college. Those awkward, sudden, stupid selfies with friends. Random objects in the street. Sometimes I think about asking my friends to send me their copies, but I never do. I just replay the frames in my head: sleepless nights playing cards, watching movies, going for a cup of chai in the evening. The feeling that we were growing up, going different directions, and that the fun was ending there.
There were so many photos. Videos, too. I remember once I recorded crickets chirping. I was with a friend, and I felt like I wasn't just capturing the sound, but the moment itself.

Now, as I silently pass my mid-twenties, I tend to forget things. Maybe I need to pause a little. Not just go with the flow. Old things help—the books I read, the movies I saw, the songs I listened—they all captured an essence of a time. They help me to remember.

I have this one fragment from when I was maybe 4 years old. I’m entering our house. I don't remember anything else—just me, one foot inside the door. That's it. Nothing before, nothing after.

Sometimes it’s hard to believe my own mind. Did it really happen as I remember? Was it really me in those tiny pixels? During the lockdown, I used to go out with a friend often. But I cannot clearly remember if we really went to that dry river. Did we walk in the sand to reach that narrow stream of water? Did we discuss songs?

Are these memories important? I don't know. But who am I without those?

Nowadays I try to keep backups. I don't really look at the photos, though. Maybe I will someday. But for now, I let them rest in 0s and 1s in my hard drive. I just need to know I have the moment captured. Maybe it’ll help me remember my trail.
